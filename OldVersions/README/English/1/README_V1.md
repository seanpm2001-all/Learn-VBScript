### Learning VBScript

I know very little about VBScript, and I don't know the DotNet version.

I only know how to make fake error messages and comments at the moment.

#### Visual Basic fake dialog boxes

```vb
x=msgbox("Add an error description here", 2+16, "2+16 dialog box")
x=msgbox("Add an error description here", 2+32, "2+32 dialog box")
x=msgbox("Add an error description here", 2+48, "2+48 dialog box")
x=msgbox("Add an error description here", 2+64, "2+64 dialog box")
```

I don't remember what the codes signify, I just use `16` `32` `48` and `64` because it gives a different icon.

#### Visual Basic comments

```vb
' This is a comment in VBScript
```

Visual Basic comments are very simple.
